## About the Project

**kinobilletter** is a demo web application of a cinema ticket system created in intelliJ. It is based on an obligatory assignment from the [Web Programming course](https://student.oslomet.no/studier/-/studieinfo/emne/DATA1700/2022/H%C3%98ST) at OsloMet in 2022. This project expands significantly on the original assignment, providing a more polished and functional user experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Backgrounds:** Changes based on the selected movie.
- **Trailer Integration:** Renders a movie trailer below the "Buy" button for each selected movie.
- **Minimalistic Design:** Features a large card with a glasslike, see-through style, blue tint, and gradient color changes.
- **Responsive Layout:** Adapts to different screen sizes for an optimized user experience.
- **Admin Authentication:** Allows new admin registration and secure login with encrypted passwords.
- **In-Memory Database:** Uses an H2 database for demonstration purposes.
- **Admin Functions:** Provides an admin account to delete all purchased tickets.
- **Docker Support:** Includes a Dockerfile for easy deployment on platforms like Render.com.

## Technology Used

- **Backend:** Maven Spring Boot framework with Java for database communication.
- **Frontend:** HTML5, styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS rules, and JavaScript with jQuery.
- **Database:** In-memory H2 database.
